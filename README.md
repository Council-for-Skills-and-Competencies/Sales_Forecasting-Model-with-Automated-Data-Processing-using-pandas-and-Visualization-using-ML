#  EPBL Project Report – EV Sales Forecasting Using Machine Learning

##  About the Project

This project presents a **machine learning and deep learning-based forecasting model** to predict **Electric Vehicle (EV) sales** globally. It combines **data preprocessing, LSTM-based forecasting, and interactive visualization** to deliver insights for policymakers, businesses, and sustainability advocates.

##  Key Features

*  **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Cleaned and structured global EV sales data from the International Energy Agency (IEA).
*  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identified trends, anomalies, and region-wise sales distribution.
* **Deep Learning Forecasting** – LSTM model predicts EV sales from **2024–2030**.
* **Interactive Dashboard** – Built using **Streamlit + Plotly** for dynamic charts and region-based analysis.
*  **User-Friendly Insights** – Sales trends, YoY growth, market share, and forecast results visualized clearly.

##  Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Frameworks & Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* **Visualization Tools:** Plotly, Matplotlib
* **Deployment:** Streamlit Web App

##  Results & Insights

* Forecast predicts **global EV sales surpassing 17 million by 2030**.
* **China, Europe, and North America** lead in market share.
* Dashboard enables **interactive exploration** of historical and forecasted trends.

##  Why This Project Matters

EV adoption is a **key driver of sustainability**. By providing accurate forecasts, this project helps:

* Policy makers plan future infrastructure.
* Businesses optimize supply chain and production.
* Investors make data-driven decisions.
